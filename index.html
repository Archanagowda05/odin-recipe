      <h3>Idli-Chutney</h3>
      <p><b>Idli chutney</b> is a traditional South Indian side dish that perfectly complements the soft and fluffy
        steamed idlis. It is typically made from fresh coconut, roasted chana dal, green or red chilies, and tamarind,
        all blended into a smooth and creamy mixture. The chutney is then enhanced with a flavorful tempering of mustard
        seeds, curry leaves, and urad dal, which adds aroma and depth to its taste. Depending on regional preferences,
        variations like tomato chutney, peanut chutney, mint chutney, or onion chutney are also popular. With its rich,
        spicy, and tangy flavor, idli chutney balances the mildness of idlis and adds a delightful freshness to any
        South Indian breakfast. Served fresh and often slightly chilled, it represents the authentic essence and
        simplicity of South Indian cuisine.

      <h3>Pongal</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Pongal/b> is a popular South Indian dish as well as a traditional festival celebrated with great joy and
          devotion. As a dish, Pongal is made by cooking rice and moong dal together until soft, then seasoning it with
          ghee, black pepper, cumin seeds, ginger, and cashew nuts for a rich, aromatic flavor. It is often served hot
          with coconut chutney and sambar, making it a comforting and wholesome meal. There are two main types — **Ven
          Pongal**, a savory version, and **Sakkarai Pongal**, a sweet version made with jaggery, ghee, and dry fruits.
          As a festival, **Pongal** marks the harvest season in Tamil Nadu and is dedicated to the Sun God, symbolizing
          gratitude for a bountiful harvest. The dish is traditionally cooked in new earthen pots during the
          celebrations, as families gather to rejoice in prosperity, happiness, and togetherness.

      <h3>Biryani</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Biryani</b> is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent and is now loved
        across the world. It is made by layering fragrant **basmati rice** with **marinated meat** such as chicken,
        mutton, fish, or sometimes vegetables, along with a rich blend of **spices** like saffron, cardamom, cloves, and
        bay leaves. Slow-cooked using the **dum method**, the flavors of the meat and spices infuse deeply into the
        rice, creating a mouthwatering aroma and taste. Each region in India has its own unique version — the
        **Hyderabadi biryani** is spicy and royal, while the **Lucknowi (Awadhi) biryani** is mild and aromatic. Often
        served with **raita, salad, or boiled eggs**, biryani is not just a meal but a festive delicacy that symbolizes
        warmth, celebration, and the rich culinary heritage of India.
